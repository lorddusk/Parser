# Parser
Parser for Crawlers


Create .env with 3 variables
DATA < website where data is stored (Optional, but needs to exist in the .env file)
MONGODB_LOCAL < database where you want to store data locally (Optional)
MONGODB < database where you want to store data remotely

where Local is optional (I use it to push stuff locally instead of the server)


run main.py, edit fileList if you want to specificy what you want to parse.
